React Native with TS, React Navigation, Redux-toolkit, Styled components

- styled-components is being used for styling purpose to abstract all style related code into separate file and keep the component clean and minimal.

## Getting Started

`npm install`

## Run On Devices

- Android `npm run android`
- iOS `npx pod-install ios && npm run ios`

## Testing

For unit test I have used `@testing-library/react-native`. I have written a basic Button Test. I believe that we should set a overall coverage for tests in the project to make sure that we are testing our statement , branches and functions properly. In my current project we are have around 82% of test coverage and our first version of app launch was mostly dependent on Unit Test.
